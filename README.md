# Introduction

The goal of MediCare is to provide a digital platform that facilitates the management and provision of healthcare services, improving the efficiency, quality and accessibility of healthcare. 
Medicare will reduce the waiting time for medical examinations, as well as simplify the administrative and bureaucratic processes of which we hear a lot, especially in the context of Italian health.  
MediCare offers many features to help patients handle their reservations, manage their medical records, explore a drug database, everything in an interconnected manner with doctors.
